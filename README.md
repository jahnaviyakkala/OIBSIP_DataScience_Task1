Task 1: Iris Flower Classification

Objective:

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that classifies Iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — based on their sepal and petal measurements.

Tools & Technologies Used:

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

Steps Performed:

Imported Dataset (Iris dataset using CSV file)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – checked dataset info, missing values, and visualized distributions

Preprocessing – label encoding of species, feature scaling

Model Training – trained multiple models (Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression)

Evaluation – used accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix

Prediction – predicted flower species for new input measurements

Outcome:

Achieved model accuracy of around 97–100% using Random Forest Classifier.

Successfully classified Iris flowers into their correct species.

Built a scalable, reusable machine learning pipeline for classification tasks.

Learning Experience:

This project helped me understand:

The basics of supervised learning

Importance of preprocessing and scaling

Model evaluation metrics in ML

Real-world dataset handling and GitHub submission workflow
